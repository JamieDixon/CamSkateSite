# Cam Skate Website

The website for [The Warehouse Indoor Skatepark](https://cam-skate.co.uk) in Cambridge, UK — run by Skateboard Cambridge CIC (trading as Cam Skate), a Community Interest Company.

Volunteers are welcome to contribute. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Stack

Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build step, no framework, no backend. Session times are pulled live from a public Google Calendar on page load.

## Running locally

Clone the repo, then serve the directory with any static file server. A couple of easy options:

```bash
# Python 3 (built into macOS and most Linux distros)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or Node
npx serve .
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

Note: the Google Calendar API key is restricted to `cam-skate.co.uk`, so the calendar widgets (opening hours, weekly schedule, session carousel) will not load data when running on `localhost`. The rest of the site works normally. If you need the calendar to load locally, ask a maintainer to add `localhost` to the allowed referrers.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on Netlify and rebuilds automatically on every push to `main`. To deploy a change: open a pull request, get it reviewed, merge to `main`, and Netlify takes care of the rest.
